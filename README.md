# Movie Fight Club

> Assume that the client cannot decide on which movie to watch between two choices.
> Allow the client to enter both choices via movie title in a search bar and then compaire the two.
> Using an API key in conjunction with [The Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com), pull the IMDB ratings for both selections and display the "winner" based on highest rating score.
> Using an additional [YouTube Data API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3), upon displaying results, also display a trailer (if available) for both movies from YouTube.
> Emphasize the "winning" selection using a border color or trophy icon.
> Live demo: [![Movie Fight Club](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Movie Fight Club-blue?logo=link)](https://shadowfre4k.github.io/Movie-Fight-Club/)

- For movies still in theatres, display local showtimes based on users location.
- Tidy up the CSS with more "Doughnut Sprinkles".
